# Honey Badger

A simple, offline-first CV/resume builder. Fill in the form, see a live preview, then export to PDF or save your data as JSON. No account, no backend — your data stays in your hands.

## Features

- **Live preview** — Form on the left, CV preview on the right. Updates as you type.
- **JSON in, JSON out** — Download your CV as a JSON file. Upload it later to restore or edit. You can version it in Git, back it up, or migrate from other tools (JSON Resume–style format supported).
- **Export to PDF** — Choose the file name and (in supported browsers) the folder. Preview matches the PDF layout.
- **Offline** — Open the project in a browser; no server or sign-up required.
- **Two languages** — Interface in English and Russian (EN/RU dropdown).
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA, skip link, tooltips. Escape blurs fields; modal traps focus.
- **Responsive** — On narrow screens, the form stacks above the preview.
- **User-friendly** — Empty-state hints, success/error messages for JSON import, confirm before reset, fast tooltips on buttons.
